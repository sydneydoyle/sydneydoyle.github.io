          <p>To address user challenges in navigating content related to app governance solutions, I conducted a review of analytics in Doc360 and performed both internal stakeholder surveys and external user research. Insights from this research revealed that users struggled to locate and understand key resources on governance topics, particularly during the onboarding process.</p>

          <p>In response, I restructured the Knowledge Base by applying principles of information architecture and usability. I identified five core areas critical to admin and governance workflows:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Instance Setup</li>
            <li>User Management</li>
            <li>App Management</li>
            <li>Shop Floor Management</li>
            <li>Workspace Management</li>
          </ul>

          <p>I developed an overview article to serve as an entry point for users, which was strategically placed in the "Get Started" section of the Knowledge Base. This article provided clear user pathways by linking directly to detailed introductory articles for each of the five areas.</p>

          <p>Because my audience was manufacturing process engineers who likely have never worked with this type of software before, I immediately emphasized both the value of platform governance as well as the consequences and risks of failing to build a control program.</p>

          <p>By organizing content around these key themes and crafting contextual overviews, I enhanced the discoverability of resources, streamlined the user journey, and reduced cognitive load for users exploring governance solutions.</p>

          <p>In the 6 months following publication, this overview article alone saw a 160% increase in engagement compared to the prior 6 months.</p>

        <p>This series of articles was developed after identifying a significant gap in both internal and external knowledge around a core concept the organization aimed to promote. Existing resources for scoring customers on their digital maturity and readiness to adopt our platform were vague and undefined. To address this, I synthesized siloed data from subject matter experts (SMEs) to create clear, actionable checklists that outlined the key areas a customer's organization must address:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Governance</li>
            <li>Digital Maturity</li>
            <li>Financial Frameworks</li>
            <li>Employee Capabilities and Skills</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Using Figma and Adobe Acrobat, I created interactive checklists that allowed users to engage with the content more dynamically. I then authored an overview article explaining digital transformation, accompanied by four supplementary articles that detailed each of the key areas.</p>

          <p>These resources became essential tools for executives to present digital transformation at conferences, as well as for presales and customer success teams during customer engagements. They defined a critical concept for the first time, bridging a knowledge gap that had previously hindered both internal understanding and effective customer communication.</p>

        <p>In this work sample, I collaborated cross-functionally with product design and applied my own knowledge of user research principles to teach new manufacturing no-code app builders—many with no prior experience in app design—how to integrate user-centered design into their process. To illustrate the costs of neglecting user research, I showed how small inefficiencies, like operators struggling to find data or buttons, can lead to significant production losses over time (e.g., 1 hour/day of inefficiency for 200 operators equals 25 Full-Time Employees' worth of wasted work annually).</p>

<p>I created simple diagrams in Figma that outlined steps of the user research process.</p>

<p>I also introduced user research concepts like discovery interviews and usability testing within a manufacturing context to target my audience. For example, I tailored example questions to the nuances of manufacturing workflows, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What equipment is involved in the manufacturing activities?</li>
  <li>How do operators interact with the overall process, including hand-offs, material flow, and equipment sharing?</li>
  <li>What tools are used, and how do they influence interaction patterns?</li>
  <li>Are operators wearing gloves or using other protective gear that may limit touch screen usability?</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result of these efforts, interest in app design grew 138% from 2024 to 2025.</p>

          <p>This work sample includes instructional diagrams I designed to illustrate a complex technical concept. These diagrams were part of a larger course aimed at simplifying the topic for learners. Each diagram was created with a focus on clarity, visual hierarchy, and alignment with best practices in instructional design.</p>

<p>The course also featured a paired instructional video, which I scripted. I am happy to walk through the diagrams and review the paired video/course in detail during a call.</p>

            <p>In this work sample, I collaborated with the app development and app library teams to create a tutorial app that highlights app design best practices. This accompanying documentation article serves as a comprehensive guide, aimed at users without a design background.</p>

<p>I also worked cross-functionally with product design and applied my own knowledge of UX/UI principles to identify and explain key design decisions. Within the app, I included tangible visual examples of both good and bad design choices, helping users understand the impact of those decisions in real-world contexts.</p>

<p>As a result of these efforts, interest in app design grew 138% from 2024 to 2025.</p>
